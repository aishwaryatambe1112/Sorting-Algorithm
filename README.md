This repository contains Python implementations of commonly used sorting algorithms along with a simple benchmarking script to measure their execution time.

Algorithms Included:
1) Bubble Sort

2) Selection Sort

3) Insertion Sort

4) Merge Sort

5) Quick Sort

Key Features:-
-Uses the same input array for fair comparison
-Measures execution time using time.perf_counter()
-Clean and easy-to-read Python code
